//How does it know how much space to reserver?

	//3. declare another int and check the address

	//An array name is a constant pointer to the first element in an array
	
	cout << "*pk = " << *pk << endl;
	pk++;
	cout << "*pk = " << *pk << endl;
	//pros and cons to this?
	
	//Why is this dangerous?

	cout << "o currently " << *o << endl;
	
	*o = 7.894;
	
	//Whats the difference?
	//well remember this
	cout << "o is actually this " << o << endl;
	
	//although you can initialize at the same time
	double ee = 3.14159;

	//what does it mean if a pointer == 0. Not the content but the pointer
	
	delete dd; 
	
	//cout << "dd after deletion " << *dd << endl;
	
	//talk about this
	float ff[20];
	float* const gg = new float[20];
	
	//advantages create and destroy, size can be adjusted during execution
	
	//when you pass a pointer you pass it by reference double*&
	//review example 7.16
	//review you can have arrays of pointers and pointers to arrays
	//pointers to pointers
	//pointers to functions
	//const pointers and pointers to constants
