	//1. create a block scope variable with a variable called x
	//print this variable within that scope and then print x again after that block
		{
			int x{4};
			cout <<x<<endl;
		
		}
	//Does this have any use?
	
	//2. Uncomment the increase function. 
	//Create a variable ACCUM where it can be accessed by main or increase. 
	
	cout << ACCUM << endl;
	increase();
	cout << ACCUM << endl;
		
	//3. Place this function and variable in another file. 
	//Should the ACCUM variable be in the h or functions.cpp?
	//How do you "link" the variable to this file?
	//How can you prevent this linkage
	
	//4. Print my gravity from const.h
	//Create your own my_gravity and see if it overides.
	//Use scope resolution to access the global constant.
	//Transform it into a namespace.
	//How does "using namespace affect it?
	
	//double my_gravity = 8.4;	
	//cout << my_gravity << endl;
	
	//Why are non-const global variables bad practice?
	
	//5. Call increase2 3 times. What is the output?
	//Change it so that accum value is kept.
	//How does this vary with global variables?
	
	//increase2();
	//increase2();
	//increase2();

	//Note: I was unable to get my compiler to complain about implicit conversions
	//Note: I'm saving strings for a strings vs strings discussion later
	
	//6. Create a enum type for storing 4 types of monsters. 
	//Print each one. How are they actually stored?
	//What all does the previous question imply as to equality?
	//Create a variable of type monster and print it.
	//How could you change it so you are printing the actual type?
	//Reset the number system with -1 on the first monster and reprint. 
	//Does enum add any actual functionality?
	//Change it to an enum class and observe the results. 
	
	//7. Create a couple of typedefs. 
	//At this level, what's the usefulness of this?
	
	//8. Create a student struct. 
	//Initialize the struct. 
	//What are the uses for a struct?
	//They are similar to what?
