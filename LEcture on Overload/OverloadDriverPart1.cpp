	//2. Create a void assignment overload for each class above
	
		//Think about how assignment works p1 = p2; 
		//Function wise this would look like p1.eq(p2);
		//On the left is the calling object and on the right is the object being sent
		
	//3. Test the void assignment operators
	//4. Attempt to "chain" (p1 = p2 = p3) and observe the results.
	//5. Why does this fail? How do we fix it?
	//6. What's the difference in the assignment operator and the construtor?
	
	
	//7. Now for something more complicated. I want to be able to say p1 = p2 + p3;
		//How does "replacement work?"
		//Why would an arithmetic expression need two arguments and why does the 
		//assignment only need one?
		
	//8. How many "objects" are involved in an arithmetic expression?
	//9. What is a "friend?"
	//10. Create a friend function for overloading addition on point and line. 
	//11. Test
		//How could we implement this without making the function a "friend?"
		//How could we implement it as a member function?
		
	//12. Implement the subtraction overload for homework
	//13. Would compound assignment operators be member functions?
	//14. Would relational operators be member functions?
	//15. Implement the equality and inequality operator for points and lines as homework
	//16. Implement the <> operators for lines based on line length
	//17. Implement any one of the compound assignment operators for homework
	//18. Next class we'll work on streams, conversion, increment/decrement, and subscript
