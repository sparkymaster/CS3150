//11. inheritance allowed: single; multiple; multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid
//12. What do these two classes create an opportunity for?

//5. Create an instance of an employee
//Employee e1("Bob", 'M', 0001, "Janitor", Date(1,1,1), 45000);
//How is this an example of linear inheritance and composition?

//6. Use printObj to show the information of employee
//e1.printObj();
//What is this an example of

//7. Create an employee using a no argument constructor and add print statements to each no argument construtor
//Employee e2; 

//In what order are constructors called
//Test this with destructors as well

//8. Try to access a private object of the parent
//9. Change to protected and try again

//10. Change public modifier to private and observe the result

//go back up to share holder

//13. Create a boss that is both a shareholder and an employee
//14. How do you distinguish between members variables that have the same name in two inherited classes?
//15. How do you call a method in the base class if your method is named the same as a method in the base class?
