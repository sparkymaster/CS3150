Lab 6 Quote Generator
Due Tuesday by 11:59pm Points 100 Submitting a file upload File Types cpp and h
Create a quote generator using classes. This class will need a constructor and a destructor. (Make your destructor clean up anything you created.) It will also need member functions to add/remove/randomly select/display a quote. Make each line a quote to itself. In your driver if your user calls the application with a filename reply with a random quote. If they call it without a filename, then request the filename and then start an interactive menu to:

1. Get random quote

2. Add quote

3. Remove quote by line

4. Get specific quote by line

5. Get number of current quotes

Make sure to at least have:

Private members: filename, file array(or list)

Public functions: add, remove(line #), quote count, getQuote

Separate your driver and class files and use a header file.

Tips: 

- One approach would be to have your constructor read in the file into an array or a more complicated structure and work from there. Another option would be to work with pointers within the file.

- Don't try to edit the file. Just create another one

- Here's a quote file to get you started: Quotes.txtPreview the document
